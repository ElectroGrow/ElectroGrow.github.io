                <p><em>(Originally published in January 2014, following an experiment the previous summer)</em></p>
<p>Here’s an email I received last September from a friend of mine who was interested in trying out electroculture:</p>
<p><em><span style="background: white;">“This summer I planted a vegetable garden in my front yard. I planted tomatoes, eggplant, broccoli, peppers, and chard. I wanted to to try David Wechsler’s “electric fertilizer” concept, so I constructed a crude magnetic field generator: an old Samsung phone charger with a 5v, 550 ma output, connected by lamp cord to two three-inch nails, one connected to each wire of the charger. I buried the nails, upright, some distance apart, just below the ground in the center of the garden, and plugged the charger into an outside 110v plug. The garden is about 25 feet by 14 feet. The long axis is east to west. The nails were positioned on the east and west sides.</span></em><br><em><span style="background: white;">I was surprised at what a strong effect the electrical fertilizer unit had on my garden. This was especially noticeable with the tomatoes. The tomatoes near the field generator grew much larger and ripened a good week or more earlier than the distant ones. This also happened with the broccoli and eggplant. The plants nearest the field generator grew noticeably bigger and ripened much faster than the more distant ones.</span></em><br><em><span style="background: white;">Now, at the end of the season, this effect is still visible. I am picking all the last ripe tomatoes from the plants nearest the electricity.</span></em><br><em><span style="background: white;">So I was impressed, and I intend to use this system again next year. I am thinking that something a little more professionally constructed than a phone charger, lamp cord, and nails might be nice”.</span></em><br><span style="font-family: Roboto; color: #676767; background: white;">– </span><a href="http://moleculefarm.blogspot.com/"><span style="font-family: inherit; background: white;">Bill Perry, </span></a>St. Louis, MO<br><span style="background: white;"> </span><br><span style="background: white;">Here’s a picture of what the garden looked like before the electric system was installed:</span></p>
<p><img class="post__image post__image--center" src="https://electrogrow.github.io/media/posts/5/bp_garden1_2013.jpg" alt="Garden before electric field is applied" width="500" height="275"></p>
<p>Bill’s garden a few weeks later.  Note the two sets of plants beyond the walking path. <img class="post__image post__image--center" src="https://electrogrow.github.io/media/posts/5/bp_garden2_2013.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="322"></p>
<p>You can see that the row of plants closest to the path is taller than the rows further away..  This is due to the fact that the electric field is originating next to the path.  As the field diminishes over distance, so does the growth amplification effect.</p>
<p> <img class="post__image post__image--center" src="https://electrogrow.github.io/media/posts/5/bp_garden3_2013.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>This photo shows how the broccoli plants to the lower right are larger than the ones moving left-ward. The positive electrode is about 8 feet away to the right from the largest plant in the center.  It’s interesting to note that as the electric field diminishes over distance, so does plant height and leaf area.</p>
<p>The effect can also be seen on his tomatoes…. Here are some pics depicting the average differences in size, based on distance away from the electrodes:</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;"><em>(originally published December 23, 2014)</em></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">Huh?!? Yeah… Don’t believe it? Read on…</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">While the last two articles covered how naturally-occurring electric fields were discovered to improve plant growth, at this time I’d like to touch briefly on how naturally-occurring sounds may elicit similar enhancements.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">To begin, have you ever heard of an album called “Music to Grow Plants”? It’s a record album by Dr. George Milstein in 1972, the same era of time when the book called _</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060915870/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060915870&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hightecom06-20">“The Secret Life of Plants”</a><span style="color: #676767;"> was published. It was claimed that the songs on that recording contained special sounds that actually improved growth…</span><a href="http://www.rootsimple.com/2010/03/music-to-grow-plants/">Root Simple</a><span style="color: #676767;"> has a post on it that actually links to the actual album and song samples. Another book from back then that documented these experiments was one by </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0875161707/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0875161707&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hightecom06-20&amp;linkId=GK2QX3QBAPV7RCFB">Dorothy Retallack, “The Sound of Music and Plants”</a><span style="color: #676767;">.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">Strange as it sounded back then, nowadays, more people are working on research that shows it may not be as far fetched as once thought!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: Roboto; font-size: 22.5pt; color: #676767;">Modern Plant Sound Research &amp; Experimentation</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">First of all, one researcher who has been in the electroculture scene for some time who is also experimenting with the effects of sound waves on plant growth is Yannick Van Doorne. On his website, </span><a href="http://www.musicforyourplants.com/">Music For Your Plants</a><span style="color: #676767;">, he shares the history of this topic as well as his own research.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">Another researcher of interest is </span><a href="https://plantintelligence.wordpress.com/tag/monica-gagliano/">Dr. Monica Gagliano</a><span style="color: #676767;"> of the University of Western Austrailia. She is an expert in plant communication and along with others in the field have shown that plants communicate with each other in a number of ways ranging from emitting and detecting various gases, to communicating via sound waves. So like Dr. Van Doorne has discovered, she has also found that some plants respond very favorably to sounds too, as demonstrated in the show </span><a href="https://m.curiosity.com/video/what-does-the-plant-say-slo-mo-45-earth-unplugged-earth-unplugged/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=20141217fbplants">Earth Unplugged</a><span style="color: #676767;">. One such frequency was 200 Hz which was found to be very effective at causing corn to grow towards the sound source – sonotropism perhaps? An interesting next step would be to see which types or frequencies of sounds had positive effects on a wide array of plants, to see if there were any interesting correlations.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">It’s really cool that many people have taken an interest in this line of plant acceleration, as they have actually experimented with different forms of sound beyond those of nature sounds, static frequency tests, and to even more complicated forms of music, like “death metal” – which was experimentally determined to be the most effective form of music in a number of tests performed by the cast of </span><a href="http://mythbustersresults.com/episode23">MythBusters in Episode 23 (2004). There’s even an experiment that shows positive physiological changes occur when a plant is “tweeted” at – via </a>TalkToAPlant.com (now defunct)<span style="color: #676767;">.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">So perhaps when we hear that talking to plants helps them grow better, perhaps there’s more to it than just our sharing of exhaled carbon dioxide…</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">What are your thoughts on this subject? Let us know what you think in the comments below!</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">Weber and Lang are a father and son duo who are obsessed with electroculture almost as much as I am. In this brief post, I’d like to share with you some of the amazing gains that these guys achieved by simply applying 5 Volts to a number of tomato plants grown in 5 gallon buckets…</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">In preparation for science fair season. Lang and his dad got in touch with me to get advice on running some electro-horticulture experiments. They found that by growing tomato plants in a drought-resistant grow system called a </span><a href="http://www.globalbuckets.org/">sub-irrigation planter (SIP</a><span style="color: #676767;">) they didn’t have to worry about watering as much, since it became something they just needed to do every few days rather than daily.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"><span style="color: #676767;">These guys have done a great job with their experiments… Over 2-3 seasons they have consistently achieved yield gains of over 50% by weight.  This was accomplished using pulsed electroculture at a voltage of about 3.7 Volts.  Similar results can be seen by looking at how well my friend Bill did in his </span><a href="http://stage.electricfertilizer.com/electricfertilizer.com/2014/01/backyard-garden-electroculture-creates-large-broccoli-tomato-eggplants/">electrified home garden</a><span style="color: #676767;">. If you take a look at the pictures below, you’ll also see that the plants themselves tend to grow faster as well.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"> <img class="post__image" src="https://electrogrow.github.io/media/posts/3/weber-tomato-early-2014-800x367.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="367"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">As a result of their experiments, Lang has placed in the top-3 in two state science fair competitions.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7pt; font-family: inherit; font-size: 10.5pt; color: #676767;">Nowadays, they’re looking into using clones to keep the genetic variability between samples as close as possible, allowing them to fine-tune the process.</p>

<p>The HarvestStorm Alpha-1 Grow Stimulator is a system designed to make trying out electroculture easy.  Electroculture is an experimental crop-enhancement technology that has been around for over 200 years.  While traditional systems involved the use of large copper plates or high-voltages, this device makes electroculture safe &amp; easy - plug and play!  Based on our research and the needs of plants, some experimentation may be needed.  The system supports 4 different built-in signaling protocols that include well-known frequency groups like Schumann resonance frequencies, Solfreggio frequencies, and others.  The unit is expandable enabling you to share the signal with many other plants or plant groups for protocol-specific efficacy testing or deploying at-scale.  The unit comes with a pair of food-safe electrodes and a UL-rated power supply.  Custom frequencies &amp; protocols are available on-request.</p>
